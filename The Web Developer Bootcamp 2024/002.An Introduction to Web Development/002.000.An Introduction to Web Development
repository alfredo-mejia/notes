* An Introduction to Web Development (Notes)

** Section 2.1: What Matters In This Section?
   - Each section will have a "what matters" video at the beginning
   - The crucial part of this section is understanding the difference between html, css, and js
   - Important topics (but not crucial) is understanding the web, how the internet works, and HTTP request / response cycle

** Section 2.2: The Internet in 5 Minutes
   - The internet is basically just many connected devices (computers)
   - If we were to connect every computer with every other computer this would not be scalable to what we have now
   - Instead, routing is used, where one computer connects to another computer (router) and the router's job is to essentially route the connection from the sender to the sendee
   - Each computer are identified by IP addresses so the router knows where to connect you to
   - The internet are essentially networks on networks where you are routed to another computer and that computer is part of another network and route connections as well
   - Data is sent over cables in the internet, your wifi rotuer is connected to a modem and that modem to connected to a internet provider cable which eventually meet other cables and other computers
   - The sea cables of the internet use light more specifically electrons to transmit data (but that is too low level for us)
   - In summary, the intenet is a global network of networks, there are computers (servers), cables, and more to form the internet and connect various computers are connected with each other and transmit data to each other

** Section 2.3: Intro to the Web
   - The internet is the infrastructure that enables many things like emails, the web, streaming services, online gaming, etc
   - The web is just a part of what the internet transmits throughout the cables
   - The web (world wide web) is an information system where documents and others resources are available over the internet
   - These documents and resources are identified by URLs (uniform resource locators)
   - Documents and resources are transferred through the web (internet) through a protocol called http (hyper text transfer protocol)
   - HTTP is the foundation of how the world wide web works and communicates
   - HTTP is protocol which set rules on how the communication between computers should work
   - HTTP is just one protocol but the internet uses a whole stack of protocols like TCP/IP protocol and HTTP is just one protocol in that stack
   - So how does HTTP work? When a URL is visited, a request is created for a particular resource and eventually a server responds to the request by providing the resource requested
   - The browser then gets these resources and renders the webpage to the user
   - There are different types of server but in our case we are concerned with web servers who's sole purpose is to satisfy web requests
   - Thus, HTTP is a protocol to share resources between computers (client and server)
   - The web server can make sure the request (client) has necessary permissions, the resource exists, and any other rules implented in the web server
   - The client is any program / computer requesting a resource thus a browser is a client program
   - The server side is anything done in the web server like the rules, sending the resource, etc
