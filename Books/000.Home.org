* What is this?
This is just my way to talk about the books that I have read or currently reading. Think about it like my own personal blog about the books I read.
Although the heading for each book might say "notes", in reality, it is simply my thoughts about the book.
My thoughts won't be long because I want to enjoy reading and not feel the pressure to treat it as notes like my other textbooks / courses.
