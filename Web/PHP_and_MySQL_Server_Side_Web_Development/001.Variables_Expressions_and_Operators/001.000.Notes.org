* Notes

** Section 1.1: Introduction
   - PHP is a programming language that was designed to run on a web server so that when someone requests a web page, the server can generate an HTML page to send back to that specific user
   - This means that pages can be tailored to individual people which is a requirement for any site that allows users to perform tasks such as register or log in, making purchases, or even searching within the website
   - PHP was designed to work with databases like MySQL which can store data such as the content of the pages the site displays, the products a site sells, or details about members of the site
   - Using PHP, web pages can allow members to update the data stored in the database such as content management systems, online shops, or social networks
   - Websites that store their information that is displayed in a database are called database-driven websites

** Section 1.2: Static vs. Dynamic Websites
