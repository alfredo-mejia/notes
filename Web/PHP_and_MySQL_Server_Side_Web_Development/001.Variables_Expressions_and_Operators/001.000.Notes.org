* Notes

** Section 1.1: Introduction
   - PHP is a programming language that was designed to run on a web server so that when someone requests a web page, the server can generate an HTML page to send back to that specific user
   - This means that pages can be tailored to individual people which is a requirement for any site that allows users to perform tasks such as register or log in, making purchases, or even searching within the website
   - PHP was designed to work with databases like MySQL which can store data such as the content of the pages the site displays, the products a site sells, or details about members of the site
   - Using PHP, web pages can allow members to update the data stored in the database such as content management systems, online shops, or social networks
   - Websites that store their information that is displayed in a database are called database-driven websites

** Section 1.2: Static vs. Dynamic Websites
   - When a site is built using only HTML and CSS, every visitor sees the same content because they are all sent the same HTML and CSS files
   - When your browser asks for a page of a site built using HTML and CSS files, the request is sent to a web server that hosts the site
   - The web server finds the HTML file the browser requested and sends it back to the browser (the web server may also send CSS to style the page, media (e.g. images), JavaScript, and other files the page uses
   - All visitors are sent the same HTML files, so they will all see the same content, therefore, this type of site is known as a static website
   - People who update static websites need to know HTML and CSS, so if the owners want to update the text on a page, the HTML code must be manually updated and uploaded again to the web server
   - When websites are built using PHP, each visitor can see different content because the PHP page creates the HTML file that is sent to them
   - Websites like eBay, Facebook, or news sites often display new information each time you visit them and if you view the source of the pages in a browser, you will see HTML code but a programmer will not have manually updated the code between your visits
   - This type of site is known as a dynamic website because the HTML page that is sent back to the visitor created using instructions written in a language like PHP
   - So when a browser asks for a page of a site built using PHP, the request is sent to the web server, the web server finds the PHP file, and any PHP code in the file is run through a piece of software called a PHP interpreter and an HTML page is created for that one visitor
   - The web servr sends the HTML page is created for that visitor to the browser and the server does not need to keep a copy of the file because next time the PHP file is requested it creates a new HTML page for that visitor
   - PHP code is not sent back to the web browser; it is only used to create an HTML page that is then sent back to the browser and since the PHP code runs on the web server, it is called server-side programming
   - PHP can be used to create HTML pages that are tailored or personalized to each individual visitor (e.g. visitor's name, topics they are interested in, or posts from their friends)
   - So here is the run down: browser goes to the PHP url, the server runs the PHP code / file, PHP generates the HTML page and returns the HTML to the browser

** Section 1.3: PHP - The Language and the Interpreter
   - The PHP interpreter is a piece of software that runs on the web server, you can tell it what to do using code written in a language called PHP
   - Software helps people use a computer to perform specific tasks without in-depth knowledge of how the computer achieves that task
   - Each time you use a piece of software, it is capable of performing the same tasks, but it can perform those tasks with different data
   - The PHP interpreter is also a piece of software it runs as part of a web server but instead of using a graphical user interface, the PHP interpreter will do what you want using code writtein in a programming language called PHP
   - When you create a web page using PHP, that page will always perform the same tasks but it can perform those tasks using different data each time the page is requested
   - This is possible because the rules or instructions required to perform these tasks are the same for every user, but the data that every user supplies or sees can be different
   - Programming language lets you create rules that tell a computer how to perform a task and the data the program uses can be different each time the task is performed
   - When you use any programming language, you have to give the computer precise instructions, telling it exactly what you want it to do
   - When you use PHP to create a web page, you first need to work out what is the task you want to achieve and what is the data that can change each time the task is performed
   - You then give the PHP interpreter detailed instructions on how to achieve the task and use names to represent the values that can change
   - Programmers call words that represent values variables because the value they represent can change (or vary) each time the program runs

** Section 1.4: What is a PHP Page?
   - A PHP page often contains a mix of HTML and PHP code and it can be used to send an HTML page back to the browser
   #+BEGIN_SRC php
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
        <body>
           <h1>Current Year</h1>
           <p>It is: <?php echo date('Y'); ?></p>
       </body>
     </html>
   #+END_SRC

   - When the PHP interpreter opens the file it:
     - Copies any HTML code straihgt into a temporary HTML file that icreates for that visitor
     - Follows any instructions written in PHP code (which often generate content for the HTML page)
   - In the example above, it writes out inisde the paragraph element the current year
   - PHP code can perform basic tasks such as arithmetic or getting the current date, and more complex tasks like using the information sent via an HTML form to update the data stored in a database
   - When the PHP interpreter has finished processing the PHP file, it sends the temporary HTML page it created for that visitor back to their browser, then deletes the temporary HTML page

* Questions
  - *Q*: Does PHP return a HTML file that is already created or does PHP generate a HTML file and return that file to the client? Or can PHP do both?

  - *Q*: How does PHP work? For example, for HTML, CSS, and JS the browser runs the code since the browser has a JS engine. For Python, we download Python the interpreter. For C++, we download the compiler. So for PHP, what do we need?
