* Notes

** Section 8.1: The Evolution of HTML
   - HTML4 was released in 1997 and although new elements were added in HTML5 many of them have been available since HTML4
   - Some presentational elements from HTML4 have been deprecated because almost all presentational elements can be replicated using CSS
   - In 1998 XML was introduced allowing people to write their own markup languages which had stricter rules than HTML
   - Thus it decided that HTML4 should be reformulated to follow the rules of XML and it was renamed to XHTML and thus XHTML 1.0 was released in 2000
   - Since XHTML was conforming to XML rules it worked seamlessly with programs that create and process XML documents and it worked well with other data formats such as SVG which was written in XML
   - There are other formats such as MathML and CML that also use XML
   - To help the transition there were 3 flavors of XHTML
     1. Strict XHTML 1.0: Authors had to follow the rules to the letter
     2. Transitional XHTML 1.0: Authors could still follow older practices, elements, and attributes that may be removed in the future
     3. XHTML 1.0 Frameset: Authors could partition a browser window into several "frames" and each frame would hold a different HTML page
   - XHTML 1.0 is based off HTML4
   - HTML5 was first published in 2008
   - In 2014 the W3C (World Wide Wide Consortium - an international standards organization for the World Wide Web) finally issued HTML5 as a W3C recommendation
   - HTML5 has since replaced both HTML4 and XHTML 1.0 with new elements, new attributes, and a new way to web develop

** Section 8.2: DOCTYPES & Comments in HTML
   - There are several verisons of HTML so each web page should begin with a ~DOCTYPE~ declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using
   - Although browsers usually still render the web page without it, it is generally a good idea to state the ~DOCTYPE~
   - How do you specify HTML5? You simply state ~<!DOCTYPE html>~
   - If you want to add a comment to your code that will *not* be visible in the user's browser, you can add text in-between the characters ~<!-- comment -->~
   - The comments are only for the developer in HTML files and usually a good idea to add comments to make your code understandable for those reading your code (including yourself)
   - Although comments cannot be seen, if a user inspects the source code then the comments will appear
   - Comments can be used to indicate where sections of a page start and end, contain notes, or prevent elements from displaying

** Section 8.3: ID and Class Attribute (Global Attributes)
   - Every HTML element have global attributes including the ~id~ attribute and the ~class~ attribute
   - The id attribute is used to uniquely identify the element from other elements on the page
   - The id can only start with a letter or an underscore
   - No other id can be shared, all ids must be unique for that page
   - Using an id and CSS can help you style the element differently from other instances of the same HTML element (since you can identify that particular instance by using the id)
   - Not just CSS but also JS can be used with ids to allow a script to work with that particular element
   - What if you want to identify several elements as being different from other elements on the page? You do this by using the class attribute
   - The class attribute's value should describe the class it belongs to which can include zero, one, or many HTML elements
   - The class attribute is similar to id except it can distinguish a whole group of HTML elements (not just a single HTML element)
   - Thus the class attribute on any element can share the same name; it does not need to be the same one HTML element to have the same class
   - A HTML element can also have both an id and class attribute
   - Adding these attributes will not affect the presentation of an element (it actually does not do anything presentational just by adding them)
   - It is when you use CSS rules targeting the specified id or the specified class that HTML elements change in the way it is presented (styled)
   - Finally, a HTML element may have multiple classes and this is specified by simply separating the class names with a space (e.g. ~class="class1 class2 class3"~)

** Section 8.4: Block Elements and Inline Elements
   - Some elements will always apear to start on a new line in the browser window; these are known as block level elements (e.g. ~<h1>~, ~<p>~, ~<ul>~, etc.)
   - Thus if you declare a block level element it will start on a new line
   - Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements; these are known as inline elements (e.g. ~<a>~, ~<b>~, ~<em>~, etc.)
   - Thus if you declare an inline level element it will continue right next to the previous element declared

** Section 8.5: Grouping Text & Elements in a Block
   - The ~<div>~ element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box
   - For example, you might create a ~<div>~ element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (like I said this book is outdated, HTML5 introduced new semantic elements that are similar to ~<div>~ such as ~<header>~ and ~<nav>~ that would be better suited for the header of your site)
   - The ~<div>~ element is simply a generic container which allows you to group a set of elements togehter in a one block-level but it has no effect on the content or layout until it is styled in some way using CSS
   - The ~<div>~ element can also use the id attribute and class attribute to be styled later with CSS
   - This includes how much space the div block takes and changing the appearance of all the elements contained with it since CSS has inheritance properties when applying styling to a parent element
   - Div elements can be nested each other if needed to break down further groups of HTML elements
   - Div elements can make it easier to understand and follow your code since you are grouping together elements and thus breaking down your web page into small sections
   - Comments would be also useful to describe what is the purpose for the div element
   - *Note* that with HTML5 a lot of semantic elements were introduced that behave as ~<div>~ but semantically it means differently, it represents a specific type of group such as a header, footer, navigation, etc. basically it is like a div with a meaning
   - Another container element that is similar ~<div>~ is the ~<span>~ element
   - So what's the difference? The ~<span>~ element acts like an inline equivalent of the ~<div>~ element (div element is a block-level container while span is a inline-level container)
   - The ~<span>~ element is used to either contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text or inside the span element there are a number of inline elements that will be grouped using ~<span>~
   - The most common reason people use ~<span>~ is so that they can control the appearance of the content or inline elements inside the ~<span>~ element
   - To further have control of styling the ~<span>~ element, developers often use the ~<span>~ element with the id or class attribute
   - Finally, *note* that in HTML5 semantics elements were also introduced to behave similar to ~<span>~ (inline container elements) just like there are semantic elements for ~<div>~ there are semantics elements for ~<span>~ such as the ~<time>~ element
   - These semantic elements are encourgaed when applicable than just a regular ~<div>~ or ~<span>~ because it is possible to just use div or span but semantic elements had meaning to your code and to assisitive technology which makes development and accessibility great in turn making a good website

** Section 8.6: IFrames
   - An iFrame is like a little window that has been cut into your page and inside the window that was cut you will be able to see another page
   - iFrame comes from the abbreviation of inline frame
   - Common uses of iFrames including embedding content from 3rd party websites such as YouTube videos, Google Maps, Tweets, Vimeo, secure payment flows, etc
   - An iframe is created using the ~<iframe>~ element but there are a few attributes that will be needed to use iframe correctly
   - One attribute is ~src~ which specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame
   - The ~height~ and ~width~ specify the height and width of the frame in pixels 
   - ~scrolling~ attribute will not be supported in HTML5 but in HTML4 and XHTML it is supported and indicates whether the iframe should have scrollbars or not
   - The ~scrolling~ attribute can be one of the three values: yes (show scrollbar), no (hide scrollbar), and auto (show only if needed)
   - ~frameborder~ will not be supported in HTML5 but in HTML4 and XHTML it indicates whether the frame should have a border or not (value of 0 indicates no border and value of 1 indicates a border)
   - ~seamless~ is an attribute introduced in HTML5 and removes the scrollbars but since then the ~seamless~ attribute has been removed and no longer exists ([[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4804604/html5-iframe-seamless-attribute][more information in a Stackoverflow post]])

** Section 8.7: Metadata Info About Web Pages
   - The ~<meta>~ elements lives inside the ~<head>~ element and contains information about that specific web page
   - It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, whether or not it is time sensitive, and more
   - The ~<meta>~ element is a self-closing element so it does not have a closing tag and it uses the attributes to carry the information
   - The most common attributes are the ~name~ and ~content~ attributes which are often used together as these attributes specify properties of the entire page
   - The value of the ~name~ attribute is the property you are setting
   - The value of the ~content~ attribute is the value that you want to give to this property
   - For example, you do something like ~<meta name="description" content="Some description about the page">~ which here we are setting the description property and the value is provided by the content attribute
   - Technically, the value of the ~name~ attribute can be anything you want to it be but the browsers can only understand certain predefined values for the ~name~ attribute here is a  [[https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/66ca34/can_anyone_explain_in_laymans_terms_how_the_meta/][Reddit post about the discussion]]
   - Some defined values for this attribute that are commonly used are:
     1. ~description~: contains a description of the page and commonly used by search engines to understand what the page is about and is sometimes displayed in the search engine results
     2. ~keywords~: contains a list of comma-separated words that a user might search to find that page
     3. ~robots~: indicates whether search engines should add this page to their search results or not; a value of ~noindex~ can be used if this page should not be added and a vaue of ~nofollow~ can be used if search engines should add this page in their results but not any pages that it links to
   - The ~meta~ element also uses the ~http-equiv~ and ~content~ attributes in pairs (similar to name and content but now it is http-equiv and content)
   - Some defined values for ~http-equiv~ are:
     1. ~author~: defines the author of the page
     2. ~pragma~: prevents the browser from caching the page (that is storing the files locally to be faster on subsequent visits)
     3. ~expires~: browsers often cache websites so this indicates when the page should expire and no longer be cached
   - When specifying a value for ~name~ or ~http-equiv~ you must also specify the value in ~content~

** Section 8.8: Escape Characters
   - There are reserved characters that are used and reserved in HTML code
   - But what if you want to display these characters like the angled brackets? Well in order to do this you need to use "escape" characters
   - For example, to write a left angled bracket you can either write ~&lt;~ or ~&#60;~
   - These escape characters or escape codes shown above are special codes that can be used to show symbols such as copyright, trademark, currency symbols, mathematical characters, and punctuation marks
   - When using escape characters make sure it is appearing correcting in your page because not all fonts support all of the characters so you might need to specify a different font for these characters (a font that actually supports these characters) in your CSS code

* Questions
  - *Q*: What happened to XHTML?
         - [[https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/149839/is-xhtml5-dead-or-is-it-just-an-synonym-of-html5][StackExchange Answer]]
	 - [[https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/29933/why-did-xml-lose-out-to-xhtml-then-html-5-on-the-web][Another StackExchange Answer]]
	 - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/410s0a/is_xhtml_dead/][Reddit Discussion]]
         - The short answer is that it basically got replaced with HTML5
	 - The problem with HTML4 was it did not have strict rules like XML and it was also hard to gather information from websites using HTML
	 - What was the solution? Use XML to have stricter rules and be able to parse XML payloads from websites via XML parsing technologies
	 - The problem was developers weren't so motivated to XHTML, browsers often did not support all features or misunderstood XHTML support, and standards were not as high as it is today leading to bad adoption
	 - In addition, with the introduction of web APIs and JSON there was no need to use XML payloads but instead use web apis to get JSON payloads
	 - Thus when HTML5 was introduced to fix various flaws of HTML4 and introduce new features to keep up with modern web technologies
	 - So XHTML lost favor with HTML5 because HTML5 along with JSON are great tools and very sufficient for today's standards
	   
  - *Q*: If you declare a block level element and then an inline level element, would the inline element be right next to the block level element or start on a new line?
         - Let's test it then, here is the [[file:./008.010.Questions/q2.html][web page test]]
	 - The answer is that the inline element will be in the next line after the block level element
	 - Why is that? This is because the block element will take up the whole width of the screen (block) or a width specified in CSS
	 - In other words, the block element will act as a block of its surrounding areas and if any element tries to be placed then it will appear outside of the block
	 - This is why block elements take up a whole new line because they will use all the new line even if it doesn't have content so when a new element (e.g. an inline element) appears it will start in a new line because the current new line is occupied by the block element (div)

  - *Q*: Are ~<div>~ elements block elements?
         - Yes div elements are block level elements ([[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block-level_content][Mozilla Block Level Content Docs]])
    
  - *Q*: Are iFrames still used? Do we need the height and width attribute in an iFrame, can we use CSS instead?
         - [[https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/y8fxkp/do_modern_developers_actually_use_iframes_for/][Reddit Discussion]]
	 - iFrames are still used but they are mostly used to embed 3rd party services into web pages such as videos from YouTube, Google Maps, Tweets, payment services, and more
	 - Yes you can use CSS to specify height and width for an iframe element as shown in the [[file:./008.010.Questions/q4.html][example test]]
	 - In the example test we use CSS to specify the height and width

* Summary
  - HTML4 was released in 1997; it had many presentational elements such as centering elements
  - In 1998, XML was introduced and XHTML was created in 2000; XHTML reformulated (or extended) HTML4 to follow XML rules and work well with other XML data formats
  - XHTML never got full traction and in 2014 HTML5 was introduced getting rid of presentational elements and leaving it to CSS, introducing semantic elements, new elements and technologies for the modern web, and more, essentially replacing XHTML and HTML4
  - You can specify the HTML version by using ~DOCTYPE~ in the beginning of the file before writing the ~<html>~ tags (to specify HTML5 you write ~<!DOCTYPE html>~
  - You can write comments using ~<!-- comment -->~ which are ignored by the browser and are only there for the developer to see
  - The id attribute is used to provide a unique value given to an element to unqiue identify it, it cannot share the id value with any other element in the page
  - The class attribute is used to a unique value given to a /group/ of elements to uniquely identify /the/ group, the elements in the group do not have to be same type of HTML element, an element may have more than one class, and the group should be named differently than another group
  - Block elements are elements that will start on a new line and by default take up the whole width of the new line regardless of the content
  - Inline elements are elements that will take up the space of only the content and continue right next to the previous element; in other words, it will not start on a new line or take up the whole width of the new line
  - Div element is a generic *block* level container element to group elements; it has no affect on content or layout (besides being block level)
  - Span element is a generic *inline* level container element to group elements; it has no affect on content or layout (besides being inline level)
  - These are often used with ids and classes to style that particular group of elements
  - With HTML5, semantics elements were introduced, these semantic elements behave similarly to div and span but now have some sense of meaning; how so? Well now we can give a group of elements a purpose with a semantic element instead of using the div element
  - Although div elements can still be used instead of these semantic elements, semantic elements are better for assistive technology and developers because they give meaning to a group of elements or for that section (e.g. instead of using div to group elements that composes the navigation section of the web page we can now use the ~<nav>~ element)
  - The ~<iframe>~ element can be used to designate a window in your page to show another website in the window; it is often used with videos from Vimeo and Youtube, tweets, Google Maps, or any other 3rd party service
  - The book presents various attributes for ~<iframe>~ but the attributes are outdate and most no longer exist in HTML5
  - The meta element is used to represent metadata that cannot be represent by any other element; often the meta element is used with attributes to provide metadata about the page and often used by browsers and search-engines
  - Often the meta element is used with the attributes ~name~ and ~content~ as name / content pairs
  - You use the name attribute to specify what info do you want to provide and you use the content attribute to give the value to the info you want to provide (to what you specified in the name attribute)
  - You can also use the ~http-equiv~ and ~content~ pairs which is similar to name / content pairs but instead of the name attribute you use the ~http-equiv~ attribute
  - Finally, you can use escape characters in HTML to display symbols or characters that are hard to type or conflict with the HTML
  - However, not all fonts support all characters, if the font you are using does not support the symbol you are trying to display, you will need to change font to a font that does support the symbol using CSS
