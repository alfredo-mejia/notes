* Final Thoughts
** HTML Section
I have completed the HTML section of the book. This includes Chapter 1 all the way to Chapter 9. The first question that I should ask myself, did I learn anything? The answer is ehh. Almost all of the chapters follow a similar pattern: introduce a HTML element, show an example, and go over the HTML element behavior and attributes. This is very similar to Mozilla web docs except that the web docs are up-to-date while this book, in the 2020s, is outdated. The book was not as engaging as I would have liked. There were no exercises or projects to test our understanding. Plus as someone who knew a little bit of HTML before reading the book it was hard to finish. 

Although the book is outdated I did enjoy reading about old technologies such as Adobe Flash and XHTML 1.0. This book helped me get answers on why we needed new technologies, why Adobe Flash got discountined, why XHTML 1.0. didn't work, why we needed HTML5, why we needed JSON, and more. I had to research a bit to get this information for my own curiousity than my actual benefit. Nevertheless, I am going to continue with book and finish the CSS section. I know a little bit less of CSS than HTML so I hope this next section is a little more beneficial for me.

** CSS Section
In the CSS section I actually learned a lot. The biggest takeway from this section was layout. I learned how to float elements, the different positions elements can take, and the frameworks we can use to help us layout our website. I also learned how to layout images and dynamically resize them according to the window screen. Going through the CSS section I oftend asked myself many questions that the book did not cover so I would Google them and find the answers. This process made me learn a lot as well. Finally, the book went over some UX topics like questions to ask yourself, the audience, and the client and sitemaps, wireframes, card sorting, and visual hierarchy. It made me realize that the infomration architecture of a website might be different from me and the targeted audience.

Although I learned a lot in this section the majority of the information came from online resources. The book introduced the topic and if I wanted to learn more I researched the topic. For example, the book talked about frameworks specifically 960.GridSystem which is an outdated framework but I researched and found a newer framework by the same creator called unsemantic. So the book is clearly outdated but it allowed me to at least learn more about CSS.

** Overall Thoughts
Overall the book can be useful despite it being outdated. However would I recommend this book to a person trying to learn HTML & CSS? No. I would not recommend this book because there are better alternatives to learn HTML and CSS. The reason for this is because the book goes over HTML and CSS like if it was documentation. There are no exercises to test your understanding or prompts for your own projects. It goes over HTML elements and CSS properties and tells the reader what they are for. Then at the end of each chapter you have an exercise / example to complete but this exercise is virtually impossible to complete without having to go on the author's website and get the assets. In addition, there are no requirements or prompt for this exercise so you don't know the width of certain elements, the size needed, and more. So this leaves you looking at the solution to see if you are doing it right. This does not really test your knowledge or understanding. I'm not sure if the example at the end of each chapter was meant as an exercise or just an example, but my point is, this book would be 100 times better if it had exercises for readers to complete with requirements and without the need to find specific assets on the author's website.
