* Section 1.3: 12 Rules to Learn to Code
1. Trick Your Brain with the 20 Minute Rule
   - In order to become better programmers we must code throughout varies days
   - Task-switching is hard so once we set up to see TV it is hard for us to swtich and code
   - Instead, after work, try to set aside 20 minutes to code and you'll see you will spend more than 20 minutes because we have "inertia", in other words, we often don't like to swtich tasks
   - Finally, develop a habit by repeatly coding; after a month we will be naturally inclined to continue that habit

2. Code for a Purpose
