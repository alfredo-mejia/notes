* Intermediate HTML (Notes)

** Section 3.1: The List Element
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <!-- Unordered List -->
     <ul>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
       <li>Item 3</li>
     </ul>

     <!-- Ordered List -->
     <ol>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
       <li>Item 3</li>
     </ol>
   #+END_SRC

   - There are two types of lists: unordered (~<ul>~) and ordered (~<ol>~) lists
   - The tags go on separate lines because content goes in between and in between the tags goes list item elements (~<li>~)
   - All list items are enclosed inside unordered list tags or ordered list tags 

** Section 3.2: Nesting and Indentation
   - We can nest a list inside another list (e.g. unordered list inside a ordered list, vice versa, or nested lists of the same type)
   - How does that work? Well inside of list items tags (in-between), you add the list (~<ul>~ and ~<li>~) in between the tags
   - Indentation is important when nesting because it allows for better readability in your code

** Section 3.3: Anchor Elements
   - Anchor elements allows us to create hyper links
   - To create a link you need the anchor tags (~<a>~ and ~</a>~) but in addition you need an attribute
   - Attributes are added inside the opening tag just after the name of the tag and before the end of the opening tag (angle bracket)

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <a href="www.google.com">Google Link</a>
   #+END_SRC

   - Attributes add additional information to the element (in this case it says where to take you when the link is clicked on)

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <tag attrbiute=value attribute2=value>Content</tag>
   #+END_SRC

   - By default an anchor element with a link will, by default, be styled to showcase it is a hyper link
   - There are specific attributes to an element (only can be applied to that element) and there are global attributes that can be used on any element
   - Normally, text are enclosed by quotations (like the value of the href attribute) to differentiate reserved words from text

*** Section 3.3.1: Resources

**** Section 3.3.1.1: [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a][The Anchor Element]]
     - The Anchor element (~<a>~) along with its ~href~ attribute creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address
     - In between the tags should present content that explains the hyperlink and pressing enter while focused on the anchor element will activate it
     - There are various attributes such as specifying header content on http requests, treating links a certain way, links opening a new tab or not, and much much more
     - Some accessibility tips:
       1. The link should indicate where the link goes, instead of saying [here][link] it should say [view our story][link]
       2. Don't use anchor elements as fake buttons
       3. Indicate what the link will do, open a new tab, download a file, etc. (e.g. [download the file][link], [view our story (new tab)][link]
       4. If icons or images are used along with text, make sure the icons and images have an alt text
       5. Consider skip links which point to the beginning of the page's main content and allows users to bypass content repeated throughout multiple pages, such as a header navigation
       6. Make sure that spacing and size of the link is adequate enough to be clicked and not mis-clicked; this is important because people may have motor-control issues and may find it difficult if links are bunched up or small
   
** Section 3.4: Image Elements
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <img src="url" />
   #+END_SRC

   - The image tag is simple, similar to the anchor tag,
