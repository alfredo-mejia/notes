* Intermediate HTML (Notes)

** Section 3.1: The List Element
   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <!-- Unordered List -->
     <ul>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
       <li>Item 3</li>
     </ul>

     <!-- Ordered List -->
     <ol>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
       <li>Item 3</li>
     </ol>
   #+END_SRC

   - There are two types of lists: unordered (~<ul>~) and ordered (~<ol>~) lists
   - The tags go on separate lines because content goes in between and in between the tags goes list item elements (~<li>~)
   - All list items are enclosed inside unordered list tags or ordered list tags 

** Section 3.2: Nesting and Indentation
   - We can nest a list inside another list (e.g. unordered list inside a ordered list, vice versa, or nested lists of the same type)
   - How does that work? Well inside of list items tags (in-between), you add the list (~<ul>~ and ~<li>~) in between the tags
   - Indentation is important when nesting because it allows for better readability in your code

** Section 3.3: Anchor Elements
   - Anchor elements allows us to create hyper links
   - To create a link you need the anchor tags (~<a>~ and ~</a>~) but in addition you need an attribute
   - Attributes are added inside the opening tag just after the name of the tag and before the end of the opening tag (angle bracket)

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <a href="www.google.com">Google Link</a>
   #+END_SRC

   - Attributes add additional information to the element (in this case it says where to take you when the link is clicked on)

   #+BEGIN_SRC html
     <tag attrbiute=value attribute2=value>Content</tag>
   #+END_SRC

   - By default an anchor element with a link will, by default, be styled to showcase it is a hyper link
   - There are specific attributes to an element (only can be applied to that element) and there are global attributes that can be used on any element
