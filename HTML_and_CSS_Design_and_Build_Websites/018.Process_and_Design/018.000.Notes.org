* Notes

** Section 18.1: Who is the Site For?
   - Every website should be designed for the target audience - not just for yourself or the site owner, thus it is important to understand who your target audience is
   - Realistically, it is unlikely that a website will be relevant for everyone
   - Questions to ask yourself when the target audience are individuals:
     - What is the age range of your target audience?
     - Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
     - Which country do your visitors live in?
     - Do they live in urban or rural areas?
     - What is the average income of visitors?
     - What level of education do they have?
     - What is their marital or family status?
     - What is their occupation?
     - How many hours do they work per week?
     - How often do they use the web?
     - What kind of device do they use to access the web?
   - Questions to ask yourself when the target audiene are companies:
     - What is the size of the company or relevant department?
     - What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
     - Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
     - How large is the budget they control?
   - When making decisions or giving priorities, you ask yourself to look back at your audience and make decisions that make sense to your targeted audience

** Section 18.2: Why People Visit Your Website
   - Why are visitors coming to your website? Some will come across the website but most will visit for a specific reason
   - Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users
   - To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:
     - The first attemps to discover the underlying *motivations* for why visitors come to the site
     - The second examines the specific *goals* of the visitors
   - The motivations and goals are the reason why users come to the site /now/
   - Questions regarding motivation of users:
     - Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
     - If there is a specific goal is it a personal or professional one?
     - Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?
   - Questions regarding goas for the users:
     - Do they want general information / research (such as background on a topic / company) or are they after something specific (such as a particular fact or information on a product)?
     - Are they already familiar with the service or product that you offer or do they need to be introduced to it?
     - Are they looking for time sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic?
     - Do they want to discover information about a specific product or service to help them decide whether to buy it or not?
     - Do they need to contact you? If so, can they visit in person (which might require opening hours and a map)? Or might they need email or telephone contact details?

** Section 18.3: What Are Your Visitors Trying to Achieve and What Information Do Your Visitors Need?
   - First create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site
   - Then you can create fake users and assign the list of tasks / reasons of why they would come to your site to the fictional visitors you created
   - You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively
   - Look at each of the reasons why people will be visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals
   - You can prioritize levels of information from key points down to non-essential or background information
   - By ensuring that you provide the information that your visitors are looking for, they will consider your site more revelant to them
   - Therefore, you will have more opportunity to tell them any extra information that you think would be helpful to them (or to expose them to other products and services you want to promote)
   - If you do not appear relevant to them by answering their needs, however, they are likely to go elsewhere
   - Here are some questions to help you decide what information to provide for visitors to your site
     - Will visitors be familiar with your subject area / brand or do you need to introduce yourself?
     - Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it?
     - What are the most important features of what you are offering?
     - What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?
     - Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?

** Section 18.4: How Often People Visit Your Site?
   - Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others, some information, such as news may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static
   - Once a site has been built, it can take a lot of time and resources to update it frequently
   - Working out how often people are likely to revisit your site gives you an indication for how often you should update the site
   - It can often be helpful to set a schedule for when a site will be updated rather than doing it on an ad-hoc basis
   - Here are some questions to help you decide how often to update your website content:
     - How often do the same people return to purchase from you?
     - How often is your stock updated or your service changed?
     - How often is the subject updated?
     - What percentage of your visitors would return for regular updates on the subject, compared with those who will jut need the information once?

** Section 18.5: Site Maps
   - Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections of pages
   - The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure this site known as a *site map* and it will show how those pages can be grouped
   - To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting
   - Card sorting involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a separate piece of paper and then organizing the related information into groups
   - Each group relates to a page and on larger sites the pages can in turn be grouped together to create different sections of the website
   - The groups of information are then turned into the diagram that is known as the site map
   - Sometimes it can be helpful to ask people who are the target audiene to help you group related information together
   - A site map will usually begin with the homepage and if the site is large and is compartmentalized into sections then each section might require its own section homepage to link to all of the information within it
   - You may need to duplicate some information if it needs to appear on more than one page
   - The pages (or group of pages) will inform how users navigate through the site
   - Remember to focs on the goals that your visitors want to achieve

** Section 18.6: Wireframes
   - A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site, it shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require
   - A lot of designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by creating wireframes, this involves sketching or shading areas where each element on the page will go such as the logo, primary navigaion, headings and main bodies of text, user logins, etc.
   - By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that need to be on a page is included
   - You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe, it should focus on what information needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page
   - It shows you where the information needs to be appear on before considering how the page should look
   - It would be very helpful to show the wireframe of a site to a client before showing them a design allowing the client ensure it has all the functions and information it needs to offer
   - Showing a wireframe to a client allows them to forget about design and just worry about information and function, the design will come later

** Section 18.7: Getting Your Message Across Using Design
   - The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate, organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps user understand its importance and what order to read it in
   - There is so much content on a website that the designer needs to organize and prioritize the information to communicate their message and help users find what they're looking for
   - If everything had the same style it would make it much harder to understand so by making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to or away from those items
   - Designers create something known as a *visual hierarchy* to help users focus on the key messages that will draw people's attention and then guide them to subsequent messages (more about it later)
   - Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler and easier to understand
   - Users should be able to identify the purpose of each block without procesing each item and by presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style (e.g. same style for all buttons or all links) users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content (more about it later)

** Section 18.9: Visual Hierarchy
   - Most users do not read entire pages but skim to find information, thus you can create contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for
   - Size: Larger elements will grab users' attention first and it is a good idea to make headings and key points relatively large
   - Color: Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages and brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first
   - Style: An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out
   - Visual hierarchy refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see and it is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed as items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first
   - Images create a high visual contrast and often attract the eye first and images can be used to draw attention to a specific message within the page
   - A site has to achieve balance, if nothing stands out the site is boring, if everything stands out then the key messages may be missed

** Section 18.10: Grouping & Similarity
   - When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups thus grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend
   - Here are some ways this can be achieved:
     - Proximity: Several items placed close together are perceived as more related than items that are placed further apart
     - Closure: When working with a complicated arrangement of items a real or imaginary box can be formed around the elements due to their proximity and alignment
     - Continuance: When elements are placed in a line or curve then they are perceived to be more related than those that are not following the same direction (this can be used to direct a reader from one part of a page to the next)
     - White Space: Placing related items closer together and leaving a bigger gap between unrelated items
     - Color: A background color placed behind related items to emphasize their connection
     - Borders: A line can be drawn around the border of the group or between and its neighbors
   - We naturally observe similarities in design, and the things that are similar are perceived to be more related than things that are dissimilar
   - Repetition of similar color, size, orientation, texture, font, or shape, suggests that matching elements have similar importance or meaning
   - There can also have nested groups of information within larger groups of information
   - Giving a chunk of information a heading clearly tells the user whether or not the content of the groupings is relevant to them, if not they can ignore all of the elements within it (plus it might help users with screen readers hear the headings of the groupings and skip it if it is irrelevant to them)
   - Each visual chunk can contain its own hierarchy (e.g. title -> author -> text -> link)

** Section 18.11: Designing Navigation
   - Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organzied
   - Good navigation tends to follow these principles:
     - Concise: Navigation should be quick and easy to read (limit your options and no more than eight links)
     - Clear: Users should be able to predict the kind of information that they will find on the page before clicking on the link (choose single descriptive words for each link rather than phrases)
     - Selective: Primary navigation should only reflect the sections or content of the site (functions like login, search, legal information, etc. are best to be placed elsewhere on the page)
   - Some primary navigation may have a secondary navigation under the primary navigation, the footer may have a tertiary navigation, and there may be links throughout the site so the main navigation may not be the only way the user navigates the site
   - Some sites might even have a search function
   - Good navigation provides context which lets the user know where they are in the website at that moment using a differnet color or some kind of visual marker to indicate the current page
   - Each link should be big enough to click on and the appearance of the link should change when the user hovers each item or when it is clicked on plus it should be visually distinct from other content of the page to tell users that is the navigation and it is clickable
   - The more pages a site contains, the larger the number of navigation items there will be and it is best to keep the primary navigation exactly the same to have consistency

** Section 18.12: Summary
   - It is important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return
   - Site maps allow you to place the structure of a site
   - Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page
   - Design is about communiccation and visul hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them
   - You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style
   - You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present
