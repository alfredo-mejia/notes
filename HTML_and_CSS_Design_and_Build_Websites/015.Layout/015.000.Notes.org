* Notes

** Section 15.1: Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
   - CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box; this box will either be a block-level box or an inline box
   - Block level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout
   - Inline level boxes flow between surrounding text
   - You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height too)
   - To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors
   - If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element
   - It is common to group a number of elements inside a ~<div>~ (or other block-level) element (e.g. you might group together all of the elements that form the header of a site such as the logo and the main navigation)
   - The block element (e.g. ~<nav>~) contining a group of elements is then referred to as the containing element
   - A box may be nested inside several other block-level elements (the containing element is always the direct parent of that element)

** Section 15.2: Controlling the Position of Elements
   - CSS has the following *positioning schemes* that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning
   - You can specify the positioning scheme using the ~position~ property in CSS and you can float elements using the ~float~ property
   - Normal Flow:

* Summary
  - CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box
  - The box is either block-level box (which start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout) or inline-level box (which flow between surrounding text)
  - There may be nested block-level elements and the block-level element that contains the nested block-level elements are referred to as the containing element or direct parent of the nested block elements
