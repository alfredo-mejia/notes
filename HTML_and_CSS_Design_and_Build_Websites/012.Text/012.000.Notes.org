* Notes

** Section 12.1: Introduction to Text
   - Formating your text can have a significant effect on how readable your pages are
   - Appearance of text can be split into two groups: font and the font's appearance (e.g. typeface, bold or italic, font size, etc.) and appearance regardless of font such as color text, spacing, etc.

** Section 12.2: Typeface Terminology
   - Serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters; these details are known as serifs
   - In print, serif fonts were traditionally used for long passages of text because they were considered easier to read
   - Sans-Serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design
   - Screens have a lower resolution than print so if the text is small, sans-serif fonts can be clearer to read
   - Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width (non-monospace fonts have different widths)
   - Monospace fonts are commonly used for code because they algin nicely, making the text easier to follow
   - Weight: The font weight not only adds emphasis but can also affect the amount of white space and contrast on a page (e.g. light, medium, bold, black)
   - Style: Italic fonts have a cursive aspect to some of the lettering ; oblique font styles take the normal style and put it on an angle (e.g. normal, italic, oblique)
   - Stretch: In condensed (or narrow) versions of the font, letters are thinner and closer together and in expanded versions they are thicker and further apart (condensed, regular, extended)

** Section 12.3: Choosing A TypeFace
   - When choosing a typeface, it is important to understand that a browser will usually only display it if it's installed on that user's computer
   - So recall, serif fonts have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters, sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters and have a cleaner design, monospace have the same width for each character, cursive fonts have joining strokes or other cursive characteristics, and fantasy fonts usually have decorative fonts and are often used for titles
   - So back to choosing a typeface, most sites often use a small set of typefaces that are installed on most computers although there are some techniques to get around this limitation (discussed later in this chapter)
   - It is possible to specify more than one typeface and create an order of preference (in case the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed) sometimes referred to as a font stack
   - Browsers are supposed to support at least one typeface from each of the group: serif, sans-serif, monospace, cursive, and fantasy
   - For this reason, it is common to add the generic font name (the default typeface for that group) after your preferred choice of typefaces

** Section 12.4: Specifying Typefaces
   - The ~font-family~ property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies
   - The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use
   - The people who are visiting your site need the typeface you have specified installed on their computer in order for it to be displayed
   - You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that, if the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed, the browser can try to use an alternative font from the list
   - It is common to end up with a generic font name for that type of font
   - If the font is made up of more than one word then it should be put in double quotes
   - Pages usually look better if they use no more than 3 typefaces on a page

** Section 12.5: Font-Size
   - The ~font-size~ property enables you to specify a size for the font
   - There are several ways to specify the size of a font the most common are: pixels, percentages, ems
   - Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up
   - Percentages are based on the default pixel size (usually 16px) so 75% would be 12px and 200% would be 32px
   - You can propagate multiple percentages for example if you use 75% for the body then it would be 12px and then you use 75% again for the headers then it will be 9px because it is using the parent's font size
   - An em is equivalent to the width of a letter m
   - It is best to follow the scale developed by European typographers in the 16th century which is basically 8pt, 9pt, 10pt, 11pt, 12pt, 14pt, 18pt, 24pt, etc.
   - Points are for print while pixels are for screens but a pixel roughly equates to a point
   - You try to keep the proportions the same so if you use 16px for the body then the headers have to be more; if you use 12px for the body then 24px can be used for headings
   - A lot of developers have used 12px for the body but more and more are using 16px because it is bigger and easier to read
   - Best way to set the font size is by pixels since em and percentages may vary espeicallly if the default size is different
   - Pixels depends on screen resolution so the size may look larger or smaller on certain screens
   - You can also use pt instead of px but you should only use this when creating style sheets for printer-friendly versions of pages
   - Percentages are good for proportions relative to the default text size
   - Ems allow you to change the size of text relative to the size of the text in the parent element

** Section 12.6: More Font Choice
   - ~@font-face~ allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine
   - Just make sure the font's license permits it to be used that way
   - ~font-family~: specifies the name of the font; the name is used as the value of the ~font-family~ property in the rest of the style sheet (this applies to when it is inside ~@font-face~ you are giving the font you are downloading a name)
   - ~src~ property (inside ~@font-face~) specifies the path to the font; you use the ~url()~ function and inside you specify the string path to the font but you may need to specify paths to a few different verisons of the font
   - Along with ~url~ you also specify ~format~ in the value of ~src~ which specifies the format that the font is supplied in
   - Different browsers support different formats for fonts such as eot, woff, ttf, otf, and svg
   - There are programs that will convert the formats to differnet formats online
   - So you can use the ~src~ as ~src: url('font/somefont.ttf') format('woff');~
   - Again check the licenses
   - Google provides open source fonts and usually you can link the font by their own CSS file and font files on their servers

** Section 12.7: Text Appearance
   - ~font-weight~ property allows you to create bold text (e.g. normal or bold)
   - ~font-style~ property allows you to create normal, italic, or oblique text
   - ~text-transform~ property allows you to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize text
   - ~text-decoration~ property allows you to underline, overline, line-through (strighthrough), or blink (flash on and off) text
   - To understand ~line-height~ we must understand what is a descender and an ascender
   - Descender is the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline while the highest point of a letter is  called the ascender
   - Leading is a term used for the vertical space between lines of text and it is measured from the bottom of the descender on one line to the top of the ascender on the next
   - ~line-height~ property sets the height of an entire line of text, so the difference between the font-size and the line-height is equivalent to the leading (thus increasing ~line-height~ makes the vertical gap between the lines of text larger) 
   - Increasing the default amount of leading can make text easier to read
   - The verical space between lines should be larger than the space between each word as this helps the eve move along the line instead of down them
   - A good starter for ~line-height~ is around 1.4 to 1.5em
   - It is best to use em so it can be relative to the size of text the user has selected by default instead of pixels which is fixed and the default font size could vary
   - Kerning is the term used for the space between each letter
   - ~letter-spacing~ can control the space between each letter
   - It is helpful to increase the letter spacing when your heading or sentence is all in uppercase, however if it is in normal case then increasing or decreasing letter spacing may be hard to read
   - ~word-spacing~ can control the space between each word
   - When using these properties, it should be given in ems and it will be added on top of the default value specified by the font
   - The default gap between words is set by the typeface and it is unlikely that you would need to change this property regularly
   - If you increased letter spacing then increasing word spacing may help with readability
   - ~text-align~ property allows you to control the alignment of text, it can take one of four values: left, right, center, justify
   - Left indicates that the text should be left aligned, right indicates that the text should be right aligned, center allows you to center text, and justify indicates that every line in a paragraph, except the last line, should be set to take up the full width of the containing box
   - Justified text looks at the words on each inidivdual line and creates an equal gap between those words (it can look odd if you end up with large gaps between some words and smaller gaps between others)
   - It is considered easiest to read if the text is left-aligned
   - ~vertical-align~ is not intended to allow you to vertically align text in the middle of block level elements such as ~<p>~ and ~<div>~ (even it can when used with ~<td>~ and ~<th>~)
   - Instead ~vertical-align~ is commonly used with inline elements such as ~<img>~, ~<em>~, ~<strong>~ elements and it performs a task very similar to HTML ~align~ attribute used on the ~<img>~ element
   - ~vertical-align~ can take up the following values: ~baseline~, ~sub~, ~super~, ~top~, ~text-top~, ~middle~, ~bottom~, and ~text-bottom~
   - ~vertical-align~ can also take a length (usually specified in pixels or ems) or a percentage of the line height
   - In other words, ~vertical-align~ sets vertical alignment of an inline, inline-block or table-cell box (e.g. a inline element can be in the middle of the line height or the bottom or the top, etc.)
   - ~text-indent~ property allows you to indent the first line of text within an element and the amount you want the line to be indented by can be specified in a number of ways but is ususally given in pixels or ems
   - ~text-indent~ can take a negative value which means it can be used to push text off the browser window; why would you do that? Well to hide text if you want but still have the text in HTML code for search engines it is more of a hack than a proposed way of doing something
   - ~text-shadow~ property is used to create a drop shadow which is a dark version of the word just behind it and slightly offset
   - It can be used to create an embossed effect by adding a shadow that is slightly lighter than the text
   - The value of ~text-shadow~ takes up three lengths and a color for the drop shadow: first length indicates how far to the left / right the shadow should fall, the second value indicates how far to the top / bottom the shadow should fall, and third value indicates how much of a blur should be applied to the drop shadow, and the fourth is the color of the drop shadow

** Section 12.8: Text Appearance Using Pseudo Elements & Pseudo Classes
   - Recall pseudo elements can be used at the end of the selector and then specify the declarations as you would normally for any other element
   - Pseudo elements act like an extra element in the code
   - ~:first-letter~ allows you to style the first letter of the selector you have used
   - ~:first-line~ allows you to style the first line of the selector you have used
   - ~:link~ allows you to set styles for links that have not yet been visited
   - ~:visited~ allows you to set styles for links that have been clicked on
   - These two are commonly used to control colors of the links and also whether they are to appear underlined or not
   - There are other pseudo classes such as ~:hover~ which allows you to style when the user is hovering over a certain text (does not work in touch screen devices because there is no way to tell if they are hovering over an element or not)
   - ~:active~ allows you to style when an element is being activated by a user (e.g. a button is being clicked by the user)
   - ~:focus~ allows you to style when an element is in focus; focus occurs when a browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an element on the page (e.g. when your cursor is in a form input ready to accept typing, that element is said to have focus)

** Section 12.9: Attribute Selectors
   - Before we took a look at different ways to select elements but you can also select elements based on their attributes

   | Selector  | Meaning                                                                                      | Example                                                                                                                                          |

   | Space     | ~[_~_=]~ matches a specific attribute whose value appears in a space-separated list of words | ~p[class_~_="dog"]~ targets any ~<p>~ element with an attribute called class whose value is a list of space-separated words, one of which is dog |
   | Prefix    | ~[^=]~ matches a specific attribute whose value begins with a specific string                | ~p[attr^"d"]~ targets any ~<p>~ element with an attribute whose value begins with the letter "d"                                                 |
   | Substring | ~[*=]~ matches a specific attribute whose value contains a specific substring                | ~p[attr*"do"]~ targets any ~<p>~ element with an attribute whose value contains the letters "do"                                                 |
   | Suffix    | ~[$=]~ matches a specific attribute whose value ends with a specific string                  | ~p[attr$"g"]~ targets any ~<p>~ element with an attribute whose value ends with the letter "g"                                                   |

* Questions
  - *Q*: What is the difference between pseudo elements and pseudo classes?
         - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements][Mozilla Docs Pseudo Elements]]
	 - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes][Mozilla Docs Pseudo Classes]]
         - According to Mozilla: A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element
	 - Double colons (::) are used for pseudo-elements. This distinguishes pseudo-elements from pseudo-classes that use a single colon (:) in their notation.
	 - A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s), for example, the pseudo-class :hover can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled
	 - Thus the difference makes sense: pseudo elements let's you style a specific part of the selected element while a pseudo class let's you style an element under a special state of the selected element

  - *Q*: Can ~:link~ and ~:visited~ only be applied to the ~<a>~ elements?
         - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited][Mozilla Docs Visited]]
	 - [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:link][Mozilla Docs Link]]
	 - The pseudo-class applies only to ~<a>~ and ~<area>~ elements that have an ~href~ attribute
	 - The ~<area>~ element ([[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area][Mozilla Docs Area]]) defines an area inside an image map that has predefined clickable areas
	 - So only those two can be visited and link be used if and only if they have the ~href~ attribute
    
* Summary
  - Formating of text can have a significant effect on how readable your website is
  - Serif have extra details on the end of the main strokes of the letters, sans-serif do not have those strokes, monospace has the same width for every letter, and cursive are letters that connect to each other
  - Some fonts can have weight such as light, medium, bold, black, some fonts can have style normal, italic, oblique, and some can be stretched which is condensed, regular, and extend
  - When choosing a typeface it is best to use the default typefaces so it can ensure the user has that typeface, otherwise you will need to download the typeface which may cause your website to load slower
  - To specify typeface you use the ~font-family~ property and you can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that if the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed, the browser can try to use an alternative font from the list
  - ~font-size~ property enables you to specify a size for the font and it can be specified in pixels, percentages, and ems
  - You can also use ~@font-face~ to install a font on the computer of the person browsing your website but again this can slow down your computer
  - There are many properties for text appearance such as ~font-weight~, ~font-style~, ~text-transform~, ~text-decoration~, ~line-height~, ~letter-spacing~, ~vertical-align~ and so much more
  - You can also use pseudo elements and pseudo classes to control the appareance of text by specifying a specific part of a text or when the text is in a specific state
  - There are many selectors that attributes can be used to specify a selector such as specifying the selector has a class, a class value pair, etc.
