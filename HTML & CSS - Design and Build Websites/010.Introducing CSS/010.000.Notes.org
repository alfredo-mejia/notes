* Notes

** Section 10.1: Introduction to CSS
   - THe key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element
   - Recall what are block level elements and inline level elements: block level elements start on a new line while inline elements flow within the text and do not start on a new line
   - CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box and the contets of that box is presented
   - For example, for elements or "boxes" you can add a border around any of the boxes and specify the width, height, color, style, background color, and more
   - For text inside a box you can control the typeface (e.g. font which is a specific style of the typeface like Roboto which is the typeface and the font is Roboto Regular or Roboto Thin), size, color, italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, and more
   - However there are specific rules in CSS to specifically specify the ways you want to style certain elements

*** Section 10.1.1: CSS Rules
    - CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements
    - What do we mean by that? These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed
    - A CSS rule contains two parts: a *selector* and a *declaration*
    - For example:

    #+BEGIN_SRC css
      p {
	  font-family: Arial;
      }
    #+END_SRC

    - The p is the selector and indicates that all ~<p>~ elements should be shown in the Arial typeface
    - The declaration is the ~font-family: Arial~
    - Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to and the same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the elemet names with commas like ~p, h1, div {}~ (the declaraction will be applied to ~<p>~, ~<h1>~, and ~<div>~ elements)
    - Declarations indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled

*** Section 10.1.2: CSS Declaration Rules
    - Declarations are split into two parts: a property and a value
    - The property and value are separated by a colon and it ends with a semi-colon
    - CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets after specifying the selectors
    - Several /properties/ can be specified in one declaration by separating the property / value pair by a semi-color
    - Properties indicate the aspects of the element you want to change (e.g. color, font, width, etc.)
    - Values specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties (e.g. green for color, Roboto for typeface, etc.)
    - For example:

    #+BEGIN_SRC css
      h1, h2, h3 {
	  font-family: Arial;
	  color: yellow;
      }
    #+END_SRC

    - The example above says for h1, h2, and h3 elements I want the typeface to be Arial and the text color to be yellow
    - Let's do an [[file:./010.001.First CSS Example/index.html][exmaple with HTML and CSS]]

** Section 10.2: Using CSS

*** Section 10.2.1: Using External CSS
   - The ~<link>~ element can be used in a HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file to style the page
   - The ~<link>~ element is a self-closing tag and it is inside the ~<head>~ element and it should use three attributes:
     1. ~href~: specifies the path to the CSS file (often placed in a folder called css or styles)
     2. ~type~: specifies the type of document being linked to (e.g. ~text/css~)
     3. ~ref~: specifies the relationship between the HTML page and the file it is linked to (e.g. ~stylesheet~)
   - An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet
   - To do this it could have a ~<link>~ element for every CSS file it uses (e.g. one CSS file to control presentation and a second to control the layout)
   - Here is an example:

     #+BEGIN_SRC html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
	 <head>
	   <title>An Example Using External CSS</title>
	   <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
	 </head>
       </html>
     #+END_SRC
     
*** Section 10.2.2: Using Internal CSS
   - You can use the ~<style>~ element which sits inside the ~<head>~ element which allows you to include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside the ~<style>~ element
   - The ~<style>~ element should use the ~type~ attribute to indicate that the styles are specified in CSS (e.g. ~text/css~ specifies the style is in CSS)
   - Although you can use internal CSS with HTML, it is best to use an external CSS style sheet especially when building a site with more than one page
   - The benefits of using external CSS style sheet are:
     - Same style sheet can be applied to multiple pages instead of repeating them
     - Keeps the content separate from how the page looks
     - Can change the style of all pages by modifying only one file
   - Here is an example:
     
     #+BEGIN_SRC html
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html>
	 <head>
	   <title>An Example Using Internal CSS</title>
	   <style type="text/css">
	     body {
	       font-family: arial;
	     }
	   </style>
	 </head>
       </html>
     #+END_SRC

*** Section 10.2.3: Using Inline CSS
    - Another way to specify CSS are by the ~style~ attribute which is avaiable in most of the elements that appear in the body of a page
    - The CSS rules that appeared within the value of the attribute would only apply to that one element
    - Here's an example:

      #+BEGIN_SRC html
	<p style="color:red;">This is an example</p>
      #+END_SRC

** Section 10.3: CSS Selectors
   - Recall a CSS rule has one or more selectors and a declaration
   - The declaration can have one or more properties which specify some CSS property to a HTML element?
   - What are CSS selectors? CSS selectors are a pattern of elements and other terms to basically tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values declared in the declaration of the CSS rule
   - There are many different types of CSS selectors that allow you to target rules to specific elements in a HTML document
   - CSS selectors are case sensitive so they must match element names and attribute values exactly (e.g. class names, ids, any other attribute because it can be used to select a HTML element)
   - There are advanced selectors which allow you to select elements based on attributes and their values
   - Here are the list of selectors:

   | Selector                | Meaning                                                                                                                                  | Example                                                                                   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
