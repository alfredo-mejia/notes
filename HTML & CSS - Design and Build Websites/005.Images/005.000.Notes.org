** Section 5.1: Introduction to Images
   - There are many reasons why we need images in our web page but we need to do it right; for now we learn how to deal with images using HTML but later we'll learn how to include images using CSS
   - The first task is getting great looking images and this can be done using stock images from stock photo companies
   - Another tip is that if we have several images in a web page then putting them on a simple and consistent background helps the images look better as a group
   - So here are what images should do and be:
     1. Be relevant
     2. Convey information
     3. Convey the right mood
     4. Be instantly recognizable
     5. Fit the color palette
   - A good practice would be to create a folder for all of the images the web page uses, this way you have all your assets in one folder
