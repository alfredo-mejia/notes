* Notes

** Section 8.1: Introduction to Flash
   - *Note* this book is over a decade old (published in 2011) and web developement has changed since then, with that in mind, Adobe Flash has since been discountined and no longer used by virtually everyone
   - For the sake of completing the book, we will still continue with this section
   - Flash *was* a very popular technology used to add animations, video, and audio to websites
   - The files you put on your websites in Falsh were referred to as Flash movies
   - To create Flash movies you needed to purchase the Flash authoring environment from Adobe
   - When saving a Flash movie it is saved using the extension /.fla/ but to use it in your website you would have to export it into a file with the extension /.swf/
   - The file will then have the code that you can use to embed the flash movie into your website
   - In the beginning, this code inolved using the HTML elements ~<object>~ and ~<embed>~ but later started to use JavaScript
   - To run Flash movies in browsers, the browser must have installed a plugin called the Flash Player
   - Slowly over time the use of Flash decreased with the introduction of new HTML5 elements and JavaScript libraries allowing for people to easily add audio, video, and animations
